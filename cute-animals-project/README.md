# Cute Animals


## Overview
For project 2, I created a website that allows users to upload pictures of cute animals that they found directly to a site and then view them either randomly or systematially. A user who uploads an animal is then able to sign in and delete or edit the information of the animal they uploaded, but not the information of any animal another user uploaded.

Live Site: https://mighty-river-22200.herokuapp.com/animals

## Technologies Used
- Language - HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
- Design - Google Fonts, Bulma
- Project Planning - Trello
- Visual Studio Code

## Features
- Ability to upload links to the site and display them on the home page and their own independent pages.
- Carousel of the most recent three animals uploaded on the home page
- User Functionality to upload, edit, and delete animals
- Sessions to track when the User is signed in or not
- Img src tracking to check if an image has already been uploaded or not

## Future Development
- Allow users to upload their own images and store them on a cloud based server like AWS
- Create a Neural Network to identify what animal is being uploaded and reccommend that type while creating an animal
- Add a comment feature onto animals to allow people to share their thoughts
- Add user profile pictures for comments
- Add user preferences for fluff and size of animals
- Auto reccommend what a user would enjoy by fluff and size and seeing how their day is going
