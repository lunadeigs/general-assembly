# General Assembly Project Collection
A collection of projects completed while attending General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. Since attending I have 
created a new github account and when migrating over I just decided to combine the repositories into a singular directory as a portfolio
of my work from the immersive as a whole. The projects contained within are from the period of January 2021 through April 2021 and some live
demo showcases can be found on my personal site [here](https://lunadeigs.github.io/general-assembly). Below is a brief overview I have written to summerize
(in September of 2023) however each repository has remained untouched beyond small gitignore cleanups and some updates to personal information as I enjoy having
a record of my process/skill level from this time.

### Cute Animals Project

A simple express server that serves html through embedded javascript templates. Project was primarily testing understaning of MVC server architecture as well
as introducing the understanding of RESTful design. Allows users to upload and/or view images of animals they find cute! :)

### Level 20 Fitness

This project has 2 primary pieces, a backend Flask server that uses SQLalchemy to serve data from a postgres database, and a proof of concept UI/UX design mockup
of what the clientside of the server would look like. The app itself is designed to be a fitness application that uses gamification in the way dungeons and dragons levels
up characters to motivate its users to exercise.
